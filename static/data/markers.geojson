Around  9am  and  5pm,  this  road  gets  incredibly  backed  up  with  traffic,  making  it  difficult  to  use.  I  believe  this  traffic  is  due  to  new  signs  that  say  \"no  passing\",  and  an  increase  in  ticketing  for  passing  stopped  buses  that  are  loading  and  unloading  on  this  street.  This  street  is  otherwise  legal  for  cars  to  pass  on.  The  intent  of  this  \"no  passing\"  sign  was  to  make  this  street  safer  for  pedestrians  to  cross  the  road  (to  get  to  the  many  bus  stops).  This  traffic  makes  it  even  more  dangerous  to  cross  this  street  as  a  pedestrian,  and  is  frustrating  for  drivers,  so  I  believe  these  signs  are  actually  doing  the  opposite  of  what  they  were  intended  to  do.  They  are  also  especially  confusing  for  drivers,  given  that  this  street  seems  like  it  would  be  legal  to  pass  on,  and  the  signs  are  only  at  the  start  and  end  of  this  road,  and  most  drivers  use  this  road  for  neighborhood  access,  and  thus  do  not  always  see  the  signs.  It  would  be  more  beneficial  to  take  these  signs  down,  and  instead  implement  cross  walks,  or  a  pedestrian  bridge.", "request_date": "2018-02-12", "last_updated": "2018-09-27 17:22:00", "acknowledged": null, "closed": "2018-02-14 08:27:00", "minutes_to_close": 2546, "days_to_close": 2, "assigned_to": "Lieutenant Marc Plourde", "reporter_display": "Nina", "address": "2866-2900 SW 23RD TERR"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-82.33892, 29.642139]}, "properties": {"id": 4118171, "status": "Archived", "request_type": "Noise Complaint", "description": "Can  you  all  please  be  more  strict.

Not  only  is  it  forcing  drivers  to  make  an  unnecessary  stop,  delaying  their  progress,  it  also  increases  unnecessary  wear  and  tear  on  their  vehicles,  not  to  mention  the  wasted  fuel  sitting  at  the  red  light.
