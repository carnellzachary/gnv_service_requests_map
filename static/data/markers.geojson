The  construction  to  the  left-hand  side  of  drivers,  for  the  tower  going  up  on  University  Ave,  means  that  drivers  pull  into  the  crosswalk,  stare  into  morning  sun,  and  wait  for  a  gap  to  turn  right  onto  University  Ave.  In  the  meantime,  pedestrians  slip  up  to  the  corner  and  get  a  walk  sign  that  allows  them  to  walk  east,  around  the  vehicle  in  the  crosswalk,  coming  too  close  to  University  Ave  traffic,  and  entering  the  intersection  from  the  west,  in  the  opposite  direction  from  where  drivers  are  looking.  The  sightline  is  obscured  to  the  east  by  the  construction,  which  is  why  the  drivers  are  pulled  so  far  into  the  crosswalk  and  looking  intently  to  the  left.  Pedestrians  appear  very  quickly  at  this  corner,  for  reasons  I  don't  fully  understand.  It  is  possible  for  a  driver  to  begin  the  wait  at  the  red  light  with  no  one  at  the  corner  waiting  to  cross,  and  before  a  gap  has  opened  in  the  traffic,  someone  is  already  there  with  the  walk  sign  to  cross.  I  don't  know  why  I  haven't  witnessed  anyone  struck  yet.  I  think  Gainesville  is  a  lucky  place,  relatively  speaking,  given  that  the  traffic  is  eerily  dangerous.  I  will  also  note  that  impatience  is  the  dominant  mood  among  the  right-on-red  drivers  who  approach  this  intersection  in  the  morning.  In  the  evening,  I  come  the  from  the  south  to  north  and  note  that  it  is  truly  strange  that  more  people  aren't  hit.  Drivers  make  all  kinds  of  impatient  decisions  that  violate  crosswalk  spaces  at  this  intersection.  Drivers  get  stuck  in  the  crosswalk  on  University  Ave  after  having  pulled  into  the  left-hand  lane  and  failed  to  make  the  turn  before  the  light  turns  red.  This  invasion  leaves  the  pedestrians  to  edge  into  the  space  for  cyclists  as  we  all  work  our  way  across  University.

First  tenants  were  a  family  of  four  who  did  not  understand  trash  pickup  procedures  and  had  no  recycle  bins  consequently  did  not  recycle.  Their  trash  generation  always  exceeded  the  capacity  of  the  receptacle  hence  there  was  an  ever  increasing  pile  on  the  side  of  house.  They  surreptitiously  left  the  property  early  in  March  leaving  all  trash  on  the  side  of  the  property  and  in  the  house.  The  landlord  discovered  they  were  gone  about  the  beginning  of  April.  He  began  to  clean  out  the  property  and  the  trash  piles  generating  an  enormous  pile  @  the  street,  all  loose  items,  bags  and  furniture.  This  pile  stayed  there  for  a  couple  weeks  until  Codes  came  and  left  him  a  notice  on  the  property  door.  His  intention  was  to  then  turn  the  property  into  an  AirBnB  and  there  was  continuous  work  on  the  property  for  a  couple  weeks.  The  property  was  let  as  an  AirBnB  on  Graduation  weekend  to  a  large  group  (5  cars,  unknown  number  of  people).  At  present  the  property  is  now  occupied  by  a  group  of  5  men  who,  like  the  original  tenants,  do  not  comprehend  trash  removal  consequently  there  is  a  new  pile  growing  at  the  street  of  box  spring,  chairs,  some  garbage  bags  and  boxes  of  beer  cans.  There  still  is  no  city  garbage  receptacle  or  recycle  bins  and  no  attempt  to  contain  the  household  trash  which  is  encroaching  on  25th  Avenue.", "request_date": "2022-05-09", "last_updated": "2022-05-11 13:10:00", "acknowledged": "2022-05-11 13:09:00", "closed": "2022-05-11 13:09:00", "minutes_to_close": 1440, "days_to_close": 1, "assigned_to": "Public Works", "reporter_display": null, "address": "1119 NW 25TH AVE, Gainesville, FL"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-82.347276, 29.659727]}, "properties": {"id": 2670334, "status": "Closed", "request_type": "Tree / Limbs", "description": "Tree  limb  blocking  sidewalk  used  by  parents  and  children  walking  to  or  from  Parker  Elementary  school", "request_date": "2022-05-09", "last_updated": "2022-05-11 15:21:00", "acknowledged": "2022-05-11 15:21:00", "closed": "2022-05-11 15:21:00", "minutes_to_close": 2880, "days_to_close": 2, "assigned_to": "Urban Forestry Division", "reporter_display": null, "address": "806 NW 18TH TER, Gainesville, FL"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-82.393295, 29.659597]}, "properties": {"id": 2673025, "status": "Closed", "request_type": "Road Repair", "description": "Traveling  eastbound  on  NW  8th  Ave,  the  pothole  is  in  the  left  lane  right  in  front  of  the  Family  Life  Center", "request_date": "2022-05-10", "last_updated": "2022-05-17 12:07:00", "acknowledged": "2022-05-17 12:07:00", "closed": "2022-05-17 12:07:00", "minutes_to_close": 5760, "days_to_close": 4, "assigned_to": "Public Works", "reporter_display": null, "address": "4645 NW 8TH AVE, Gainesville, FL"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-82.372334, 29.625642]}, "properties": {"id": 2675814, "status": "Closed", "request_type": "Dead Animal (Public Property)", "description": "There  is  a  dead  duck  in  the  road", "request_date": "2022-05-11", "last_updated": "2022-05-11 13:12:00", "acknowledged": "2022-05-11 13:12:00", "closed": "2022-05-11 13:12:00", "minutes_to_close": 30, "days_to_close": 0, "assigned_to": "Public Works", "reporter_display": null, "address": "3093 SW 34TH ST, Gainesville, FL, 32608"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-82.368948, 29.65135]}, "properties": {"id": 2675860, "status": "Closed", "request_type": "Street Sign", "description": "Bent  and  twisted.

Parking  is  very  limited  in  that  area  and  the  spot  I  was  parked  in  seemed  like  a  viable  spot.  There  are  no  signs  that  say  not  to  park  there.  The  only  sign  posted  is  one  on  the  gate  saying  not  to  block  the  gate.  Can  please  verify  that  no  parking  is  allowed  where  I  parked.  If  no  parking  is  allowed  in  that  spot,  can  you  please  post  a  sign  there  so  no  one  will  unexpectedly  get  a  ticket.  A  lot  of  people  park  in  that  spot,  especially  on  the  weekend.  If  parking  is  allowed  in  that  spot,  can  you  please  inform  the  employees  that  it  is  allowed.  Parking  is  really  limited  in  that  area  on  weekends  and  every  extra  parking  spot  really  helps.

Why  did  she  stop  at  one,  when  we  need  two???  I  am  not  able  to  wash  laundry  (washer/dryer  is  upstairs)  due  to  the  huge  increase  in  temperature!!!!  I  cannot  cook  nor  clean  without  facing  extreme  nausea  due  to  the  lack  of  AC!  My  husband  is  68  years  old  and  cannot  continue  to  move  this  heavy  portable  unit  up  and  down  the  stairs  so  that  I  can  cook  dinner\u2026then  back  upstairs  so  that  we  can  sleep  comfortably!!!

Additionally,  customers  from  the  shopping  (moetly  food)  strip  mall  there  also  have  to  wind  through  the  neighborhood  to  find  their  way  back  on  to  University.  Please  reconsider  this  particular  one-way  street.  As  a  two-way  street,  it  had  bike  lanes.  They  were  safe  to  use  when  there  was  not  construction  there.

Well  we  now  know,  criminals  are  hiding  here!  Last  night  on  October  26  a  bunch  of  Sheriffs  came  over  to  take  the  criminal  who  has  been  living  there  for  the  past  10  months  or  so,  but  he  doesn't  live  inside  the  mobile  home  that  is  at  this  location  no,  the  house  in  inhabited  by  Aron  and  Dave.  they  have  been  living  in  the  neighbourhood  for  decades,  however,  in  the  last  year,  they  have  had  some  visitors  whom  built  an  illegal  campsite  in  the  back  of  the  house!  basically  a  shanty  town  kind  of  living  which  you  only  expect  to  see  in  some  third  world  country,  not  in  Gainesville,  USA.

These  people  are  super  suspicious  and  have  definitely  brought  a  high  level  of  insecurity  and  just  a  very  very  bad  vibe  on  the  street.  they  are  very  aggressive  and  have  already  had  confrontations  with  some  of  us.  They  use  a  quadbike  and  a  motor  bike  to  move  around,  none  of  these  have  even  tags  on  them,  as  if  we  are  correct,  it  is  illegal  anyway  to  drive  a  quadbike  on  the  streets!  Some  of  us  whom  have  confronted  them  have  been  threatened  with  rape  and  murder.  none  of  us  asked  for  this,  these  people  don't  belong  here,  they  are  illegally  living  in  dodgy  tents  in  the  back  of  Aron's  house!
